    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 1/2 cup water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl, stirring with a 
            whisk. Let stand 5 minutes or until yeast mixture is bubbly.</li>

            <li>Weigh or lightly spoon flours, potato starch, and flaxseed meal into dry 
            measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine flours, potato starch, flaxseed meal,
            xanthan gum, and salt in a large bowl; beat with a mixer at medium speed until 
            blended. Add yeast mixture, 1 tablespoon oil, egg whites, and egg; beat at low 
            speed 1 minute or until combined. Increase speed to medium; beat 2 minutes.</li>

            <li>Coat a baking sheet with 1 teaspoon oil. Scrape dough onto pan. Lightly coat 
            hands with oil. Press dough into a 14-inch circle, coating hands with oil as needed 
            to prevent dough from sticking. Coat top of dough with any remaining oil. Cover with 
            plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place (85°), free from drafts, for 30 minutes.</li>

            <li>Preheat oven to 400° Remove plastic wrap, and bake crust at 400° for 17 
            minutes or until bottom lightly browns. Cool completely. Increase oven temperature 
            to 425°.</li>

            <li>Spread marinara over crust, leaving a 1/2-inch border; top with mozzarella 
            cheese, pepperoni, and Parmesan cheese. Bake at 425° for 16 minutes or until crust 
            is golden and cheese melts.</li>
        </ol>
