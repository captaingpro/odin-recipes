            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut the chicken in half lengthwise. Sprinkle both sides with salt & 
                    pepper. Combine the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne 
                    pepper in a bowl, and measure out 2 tbsp and set aside. Dredge the chicken in
                    the flour from the larger bowl, and pan fry in the olive oil until golden. I
                    like using this cast iron skillet.</li>

                    <li>Transfer the chicken to a plate. In the skillet, melt the butter and cook 
                    the onions until golden brown and softened, giving them a stir every so often. 
                    Add the reserved seasoned flour and cook for a minute, constantly stirring. Stir 
                    in the chicken broth and Worcestershire sauce, and scrape up the brown bits.</li>

                    <li>Add in the cream, stir, and return the chicken to the pan. Cook until it's fully 
                    cooked through and the gravy has thickened. Season with salt & pepper and enjoy right 
                    away!</li>
                </ol>
